# Neptune 1

A working prototype of an Intent-Based Interface.

## What is Neptune 1?

Neptune 1 is a functional, OS-integrated prototype on macOS that demonstrates intent based interaction using natural language. Built on Raycast, Python, and OpenAI's API, it lets users express a high-level goal like “write a one-page report on biodiversity”, and receive immediate, usable output on the clipboard.

##  How It Works

- Input: User types an intent into Raycast (e.g., “Write a thank-you email to my professor.”)
- Processing: Python script sends it to OpenAI GPT for generation
- Output: Result is copied to clipboard for pasting into any environment (Pages, Gmail, Notes, etc.)

##  Status

Currently tested and operational for:
- Writing reports
- Generating emails
- Drafting product descriptions

Runs locally on macOS.

## Next Steps

Neptune 1 is just the beginning. Future versions will explore:
- System-level awareness
- UI automation
- Memory and state handling
- True multi-step execution
